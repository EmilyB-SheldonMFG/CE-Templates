It is a simpler version of the User Guide Advanced template. Although it is a basic template, the content and files have been designed to maximize single-sourcing capabilities. This template starts you out with two PDF targets, one with crop and registration marks and the other without.  It also has auto-generation of a TOC, glossary, and index. You can add other kinds of targets if you like." SourceControlProviderType="Git" ProjectGuid="b109c4c0-79f9-41ba-ba2d-b402078e3267" />
